# Liquid

Liquid is a Django-like template engine for Bun and Node.js.

This repo is a fork of [LiquidJS](https://github.com/harttle/liquidjs) with the following changes:

## Language

- Support the `{% extends %}` syntax, in addition to `{% layout %}`, for compatibility with Django templates.

## Packaging

- The package has no dependencies.
- Dropped support for the front-end usage.
- Dropped the CLI.
